### 1- How would Augmented Reality better help teach your experience?

#### a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user’s view of the real world, thus providing a composite view, which means that you can do something with the power of your mental abilities and computer power. That means your real world will be connected with the others in realtime, or you can live in your own Imagination.

### 2- How could eye tracking help you better tailor your experience to your students?

#### Have you ever imagined that you can develop a game with your eyes only ?, Eye tracking will offer this option and much more …..

### 3- How would better Haptics better teach your experience?

#### haptic technology in VR will bring your whole senses into virtual environment.More better haptics more better realism in virtual world.

### 4- How important is graphical fidelity to your experience?

#### Your eyes can see very high quality images and in high frames rate ( minimum FPS = 25 ).So for graphical fidelity you have to build your experience with high details and in great FPS so the brain won’t feel any defects in the virtual world.

### 5- How critical is it that your target student receives this training within the next two years?

#### I think the students will find this course within 2 year from now like , i receive this “ there is FHD tv in this room” . No new information ( tochnology ) is this sentence but i have to know this information to build on it the coming information ( technology ).
